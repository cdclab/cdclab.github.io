			    	<h2>Common types of stress responses</h2>
			    	<h3>1. Preoccupation with self-doubt and worries</h3>
		            <div class="flex-box gap-0">
		              <div class="flex-250">
		                <img src="./img/assessment-stress-preoccupation.webp" width="250">
		              </div>
		              <div class="flex-60">
		                <p>Some people will have a sense of failure after the interview, which evokes thoughts of self-doubt and worries related to the causes and consequences of the failure. This is common among people who tend to internalize responsibility. Accumunlating across similar situations, people may link themselves to inadequacy in their knowledge about themselves, developing an overall feeling of incompetence and distancing themselves from the external world, and eventually leading to mood disorders. </p>

		            </div>

			    	<h3>2. Flashbacks of stressful moments</h3>
		            <div class="flex-box gap-0">
		              <div class="flex-250">
		                <img src="./img/assessment-stress-flashback.webp" width="250">
		              </div>
		              <div class="flex-60">
		                <p>While some people may not think of the interviews over and over, at some times the stressful moments come up in mind again, as if they have re-experienced them in a vivid and detailed manner. These emotion-evoking memories are often not sufficiently processed and can only be retrieved in their raw form without proper elaboration to one's autobiographical memory. People with fragmented memory may be more vulnerable to intrusions and flashbacks of highly stressful moments, which is a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder and panic attacks.</p>

		              <div class="flex-60">
		                <p>In more complex situations, individuals may develop extreme self-rejecting associations and feelings of shame. Their persistent struggles to stablize themselves may lead to conditions such as somatization, dissociation, and personality dysfunctions. </p>

			    		<h3 class="additional-title">Responses to stress and self-representation</h3>
			    		<p>The reactions to such events can vary greatly from person to person. We postulate that these individual differences in reactions are related to underlying self-representations, which operate on two types of memory: event-based autobiographical memory and script-based autobiographical knowledge.</p>

							<h3 style="margin-top: 2.5em">Script-based autobiographical knowledge and preoccupation</h3>
					    	<p>Our reactions to stress are influenced by our general knowledge about ourselves. Similar to how we may have a mental script for how a job interview should go, we may also have scripts for how we should respond to stressful situations. These scripts are developed through early experiences of interacting with others who fulfill or fail to meet our needs, and their responses shape our expectations of who should take responsibility for different events and how we should manage them.</p>
					    	<p>Appropriate responses teach us how to face challenges in adaptive ways. However, individuals who often receive invalidating responses may develop maladaptive scripts, leading them to internalize responsibility when facing stress and decrease their tendency to affiliate with themselves and others. They may become preoccupied with self-doubt and worries about the causes and consequences of the stressful events.</p>
					    	<p>In our laboratory, we measure the spontaneous tendency to affiliate with oneself and others using a visuospatial perspective shifting paradigm. Interested readers can check out the page below.</p>

			    			<h3>Event-based autobiographical memory and flashback</h3>
			    			<p>In addition to general knowledge, recalling details of a particular event that one was previously in, such as the time, place, and people involved, is also essential for many social functions. To accurately remember the details, we rely on clear and separated event-based autobiographical memories (or event memories) such that each event will not be confused with one another. It is suggested that people with strong event memories have the ability to process and solidify the details of an event, and organize them around abstract labels that are coherent with other events.</p>
			    			<p>During a stressful event, this ability helps to assimilate the event as part of the self. In contrast, deficits in this ability may lead to insufficient processing of the event without linking it to the self. This can result in an under-elaborated self-representation and the raw experience of reliving the stressful moments through flashbacks, which can interfere with daily life and lead to difficulty coping with stressors.</p>
			    			<p>One way to quantify this ability to efficiently organize information in our laboratory is the use of a self-referential memory task. For more details, please read the following page.</p>

			    			<h3>Other self-representation issues</h3>
			    			<p>People with trauma-related disorders are often having negative self-evaluation to a great extent. You can read the following pages for more details.</p>
