                <h2>The Role of Flexible Perspective Shifting in Empathy and Self-Empathy</h2>
                <p>Empathy is an important sociocognitive ability for relating oneself to others. Feeling the emotions of others requires us to represent another mind in addition to our own. A similar process of representing an objectified self is involved when we get in touch with our own emotions (e.g., guilt and shame). Our studies demonstrated that the extend to which we feel the emotions of the self and others is related to the flexibility to shift from the visuospatial perspective of another to that of the self, which may indicate a role of flexible shifting between self- and other- representations in empathy.</p>

                <h2>Distorted Self-Referential Memory in Trauma-Related Disorders</h2>
                <p>Recognizing how different experiences and knowledge relate to the self is essential for many psychological functions. For example, we need to distinguish between what is proposed by the self and what is said by others in a conversation. Using a self-referential memory paradigm, we showed that trauma-related disorders, such as psychosis and dissociation, present with difficulty differentiating between self-generated and externally derived representations. This distortion of self-referential memory may be linked to an altered sense of self resulting from early relational trauma.</p>

                <h2>Biased Self-Evaluation in Trauma-Related Disorders</h2>
                <p>Our knowledge about the self accumulates through feedback from others and guides the way we interpret social information. People with early childhood relational trauma, such as emotional abuse and neglect, may develop biased self-knowledge due to frequent exposure to invalidating feedback. Associating the self with negative attributes (e.g., being rejected), which is common in people with trauma-related disorders, hence lead to dysfunctional information processing pattern. For example, it is found that self-rejecting individuals are more sensitive to negative social feedback regardless of their applicability, and have more difficulties regulating the elicited negative mood.</p>
